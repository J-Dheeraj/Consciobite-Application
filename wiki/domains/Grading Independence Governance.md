# Grading Independence & Governance

Cross-cutting concern: ensuring GreenGrade scoring is (and is perceived as) independent of commercial relationships.

---

## The Problem

Consciobite charges manufacturers for listing and grading. GreenGrade scores claim to be objective. These two facts create a conflict of interest that investors, regulators, and retail partners will flag.

## Current State (updated 2026-05-29)

- GreenGrade algorithm is deterministic (KDE + sigmoid, 7 emission dimensions) — see [[GreenGrade KDE Scoring]]
- Methodology page exists at `/methodology` in the frontend
- **Audit trail implemented** — [[Score Audit Service]] logs every score change with paying-client flag
- **Admin conflict log** — [[Admin Routes]] at `/api/admin/conflict-log` with paying/non-paying filter and aggregate stats
- **Manufacturer tracking** — `manufacturers` + `product_manufacturers` tables in SQLite
- **Score snapshots** — 550 product scores captured on every server startup; drift auto-detected
- **Governance charter drafted** — [[GreenGrade Governance Charter 2026-05-29]] defines Panel composition, mandate, firewall, access rights, and cadence. Ready for founding member review.
- **Landing page updated** — "Independent Scoring" copy replaces "No Pay-to-Win"; product count corrected to 550
- Advisory board not yet formed (candidates to be identified)
- No public disclosure page yet (Session 3 of governance brief)

## Action Plan

### Phase 1 — Advisory Panel Charter (done)

Charter drafted at `/GreenGrade_Governance_Charter.md`. See [[GreenGrade Governance Charter 2026-05-29]] for full details.

**Panel seats (3):**

| Seat | Profile | Independence Guarantee |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Academic | Food systems / LCA researcher | No consulting for Consciobite or clients |
| Regulatory | FSAI / EPA / CCPC (or consumer advocacy) | Peer credibility with regulators |
| Industry | Non-client retail/food professional | NOT a paying Consciobite client |

**Four powers:** methodology audit (annual), score challenge (14-day SLA), conflict-of-interest flag (30-day public response), annual public report (500-800 words).

**Firewall:** No paid/unpaid advisory relationships, no financial interest in clients, 12-month cooling-off. Voluntary service (no fees).

**Activation steps remaining:**
1. Identify 3 founding candidates (target: 2 weeks)
2. Share charter for comments (1 week)
3. Publish on website at `/transparency` (Session 3 code work)
4. First Panel meeting within 90 days of acceptance

### Phase 2 — Transparency Features (code changes) ✅ done (Session 3)

1. **Public methodology page** — `/methodology` already has full algorithm docs, data sources, confidence levels (done)
2. **Scoring changelog** — `methodology_changelog` SQLite table; `scoreAudit.js` functions; `GET /api/transparency/changelog` (public); `POST /api/admin/methodology-changelog` (admin); transparency page shows changelog section; seeded with v3.0 entry on startup (done)
3. **Admin landing page** — `/admin` index page linking to conflict-log and manufacturers sub-pages (done)
4. **Tests** — 9 new tests covering transparency stats and changelog CRUD; total 146 backend tests (done)

### Phase 3 — Certification (long-term)

- Pursue third-party certification (e.g. B Corp, ISO 14001 alignment)
- Align with EU Green Claims Directive requirements
- Consider open-sourcing the scoring methodology

## Technical Touchpoints

| File | Relevance | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `backend/src/services/scoreAudit.js` | Score change audit trail | Done (Session 1) |
| `backend/src/routes/admin.js` | Admin conflict log + manufacturer CRUD | Done (Session 1) |
| `backend/src/db/migrations/002_governance_layer.sql` | Governance tables | Done (Session 1) |
| `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` | `requireAdmin` middleware | Done (Session 1) |
| `backend/src/services/greengrade.js` | Core scoring algorithm | Existing — wired to audit |
| `frontend/src/app/methodology/page.js` | Public methodology page — expand for transparency | Pending (Session 3) |
| `frontend/src/app/transparency/page.js` | Public governance & stats page | Pending (Session 3) |
| `backend/src/data/products.json` | Product catalog with emission data | Existing |
