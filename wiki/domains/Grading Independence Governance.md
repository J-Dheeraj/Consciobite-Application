# Grading Independence & Governance

Cross-cutting concern: ensuring GreenGrade scoring is (and is perceived as) independent of commercial relationships.

---

## The Problem

Consciobite charges manufacturers for listing and grading. GreenGrade scores claim to be objective. These two facts create a conflict of interest that investors, regulators, and retail partners will flag.

## Current State (updated 2026-07-04)

- GreenGrade algorithm is deterministic (KDE + sigmoid, 7 emission dimensions) — see [[GreenGrade KDE Scoring]]
- Methodology page at `/methodology` — full algorithm docs, data sources, confidence tiers, academic references, and **version history changelog**
- **Audit trail implemented** — [[Score Audit Service]] logs every score change with paying-client flag
- **Admin conflict log** — [[Admin Routes]] at `/api/admin/conflict-log` with paying/non-paying filter and aggregate stats
- **Manufacturer tracking** — `manufacturers` + `product_manufacturers` tables in SQLite
- **Score snapshots** — 550 product scores captured on every server startup; drift auto-detected
- **Governance charter drafted** — [[GreenGrade Governance Charter 2026-05-29]] defines Panel composition, mandate, firewall, access rights, and cadence. Ready for founding member review.
- **Landing page updated** — "Independent Scoring" copy replaces "No Pay-to-Win"; product count corrected to 550
- **Transparency page** live at `/transparency` — independence problem statement, advisory panel seats, commitments, score change statistics
- **Scoring changelog** — `GET /api/methodology/changelog` endpoint; `/methodology` page renders collapsible v1/v2/v3 version history
- Advisory board not yet formed (candidates to be identified)

## Action Plan

### Phase 1 — Advisory Panel Charter (done)

Charter drafted at `/GreenGrade_Governance_Charter.md`. See [[GreenGrade Governance Charter 2026-05-29]] for full details.

**Panel seats (3):**

| Seat | Profile | Independence Guarantee |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Academic | Food systems / LCA researcher | No consulting for Consciobite or clients |
| Regulatory | FSAI / EPA / CCPC (or consumer advocacy) | Peer credibility with regulators |
| Industry | Non-client retail/food professional | NOT a paying Consciobite client |

**Four powers:** methodology audit (annual), score challenge (14-day SLA), conflict-of-interest flag (30-day public response), annual public report (500-800 words).

**Firewall:** No paid/unpaid advisory relationships, no financial interest in clients, 12-month cooling-off. Voluntary service (no fees).

**Activation steps remaining:**
1. Identify 3 founding candidates (target: 2 weeks)
2. Share charter for comments (1 week)
3. Publish on website at `/transparency` (Session 3 code work)
4. First Panel meeting within 90 days of acceptance

### Phase 2 — Transparency Features (complete as of 2026-07-04)

1. ✅ **Public methodology page enhancement** — full algorithm docs, 7 dimensions, confidence tiers, data sources, references, version history
2. ✅ **Scoring changelog** — `METHODOLOGY_CHANGELOG` in `dataProvenance.js`; `GET /api/methodology/changelog`; collapsible UI in `/methodology`
3. ✅ **Board disclosure page** — `/transparency` shows advisory panel seats, commitments, conflict stats
4. ✅ **Audit trail** — `scoreAudit.js` logs all score changes; `/api/admin/conflict-log`; `GET /api/v1/audit/:productId` for per-product history

### Phase 3 — Certification (long-term)

- Pursue third-party certification (e.g. B Corp, ISO 14001 alignment)
- Align with EU Green Claims Directive requirements
- Consider open-sourcing the scoring methodology
