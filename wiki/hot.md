# Hot Cache

~500-word recent-context summary. Updated after every ingest or major query.

---

**Last updated:** 2026-06-27 after Methodology Changelog feature (Session 4).

**Project:** Consciobite — Next.js 14 App Router (static export) + Node.js/Express API + SQLite. Food sustainability app. Rates grocery products A-F using GreenGrade (KDE + sigmoid scoring across 7 lifecycle emission dimensions). Features carbon tracker, barcode scanner (Open Food Facts fallback), recipe recommender, and review system.

**Stack migration (2026-05):** Frontend migrated from CRA-style React SPA to Next.js 14 App Router with `output: 'export'`. Build produces static HTML in `build/` directory (Next.js outputs to `out/`, build script renames via `rm -rf build && mv out build`). Dynamic route `/product/[id]` uses `generateStaticParams()` reading 550 product IDs from `backend/src/data/products.json` at build time. Product page split into server wrapper (`page.js`) + client component (`ProductDetailClient.js`).

**API architecture:** Domain-decomposed modules in `frontend/src/services/` — `httpClient.js` + `products.js`, `auth.js`, `reviews.js`, `carbon.js`, `recipes.js`. `httpClient.js` has `getApiBase()` for Render hostname auto-detection (`-app` -> `-api` suffix swap). No `next.config.js` rewrites (incompatible with static export).

**Deployment:** Render Static Site serves `build/` directory. `render.yaml` blueprint uses `runtime: static` with `staticPublishPath: build`. Docker uses repo-root build context (`context: .` in docker-compose.yml) so `generateStaticParams()` can access `backend/src/data/products.json` during build. Nginx serves static files with SPA fallback (`try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`).

**Recent fixes landed (2026-05-13):**
- 7 merge conflicts resolved between feature branch and main
- Backend Prettier/ESLint formatting fixed (4 backend + 9 frontend files)
- `validate()` schema fixes: removed `max: 100` from carbon quantity (let handler clamp), raised reviews `productId` maxLength from 20 to 50, removed UUID patterns from delete schemas (allow non-UUID strings to reach 404)
- Frontend ESLint migrated from `react-app` to `next/core-web-vitals`
- Unescaped JSX entities fixed (`"` -> `&ldquo;`/`&rdquo;`, `'` -> `&apos;`)
- Docker build context changed from `./frontend` to `.` (repo root) so products.json is accessible
- Dockerfile updated for repo-root-relative COPY paths
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` -> `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in docker-compose.yml

**Current test status:** 144 backend tests passing (+27 from methodology changelog, 0 regressions). Frontend builds 569 static pages.

**Active branch:** `claude/nifty-goodall-nm677g` — pushed, no PR opened yet.

**Governance layer (2026-05-29):** Session 1 complete. SQLite tables: `manufacturers`, `product_manufacturers`, `score_change_logs`, `product_scores`. Service: `scoreAudit.js` logs every score change with paying-client flag. Admin routes at `/api/admin/*` (requireAdmin middleware, checks `users.role`). Scores snapshotted on startup (550 products); changes auto-detected on server restart. **Charter drafted:** `/GreenGrade_Governance_Charter.md` — 3-seat advisory panel (academic, regulatory, non-client industry), 4 powers (methodology audit, score challenge, conflict flag, annual report), conflict-of-interest firewall, voluntary service. Landing page updated: "Independent Scoring" copy, 550 product count. Stack migration plan at [[Stack Migration Plan]].

**Methodology changelog (2026-06-27, Session 4):** Closed Phase 2 governance gap — algorithm/weight/data-source changes to GreenGrade itself are now logged, separate from per-product score drift. New `methodology_changelog` SQLite table (migration `003`), `methodologyChangelog.js` service, public `GET /api/methodology/changelog` (cached 300s), admin `GET/POST /api/admin/methodology-changelog`. Seed data grounded in real git commits (`751fd77`, `e0e9f32`, `57e046e`) rather than fabricated. Rendered on `/transparency` page as a new "Methodology Changelog" section. Backend suite now 144/144 passing (+27 tests, 0 regressions). Caught and fixed a cache-staleness bug: admin POST must call `invalidateCache("methodology/changelog")` or new entries are invisible on the public endpoint for 300s. Pushed to `claude/nifty-goodall-nm677g`. See [[Methodology Changelog Service]]. **Known gap noted, not fixed:** frontend has no test script/files despite CLAUDE.md requiring them — flagged for a future session.

**Key invariants (unchanged):**
- `AUTH_EXPIRED_EVENT` constant for 401 event bus (never raw string)
- `WEEKLY_CARBON_GOAL_KG` in `frontend/src/utils/constants.js`
- `/carbon` protected by `RequireAuth` — no in-page auth gates
- httpOnly cookies for JWT; CSRF double-submit pattern
- All Express routes use `validate()` middleware with `pattern:` not `type: "number"`
